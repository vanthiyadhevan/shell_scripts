Sure, here are some advanced level if condition programs in shell scripting:

    File Permissions Checker: Write a script that takes a filename as input and checks if the file exists. If it does, check the file's permissions and print whether it's readable, writable, or executable by the current user.

    User Authentication: Develop a script that prompts the user to enter a username and password. Check if the provided username exists in the system and if the password matches. If both are correct, print a welcome message; otherwise, print an error message.

    Directory Size Checker: Create a script that takes a directory path as input and checks if the directory exists. If it does, calculate the total size of the directory and its contents. If the total size exceeds a certain threshold, print a warning message.

    Network Connectivity Checker: Write a script that checks if the system has an active internet connection. If it does, print a message indicating successful connectivity; otherwise, print a message indicating no internet connection.

    Backup Scheduler: Develop a script that checks the current time and day of the week. If it's Sunday evening, prompt the user to confirm whether they want to schedule a backup. If confirmed, initiate the backup process; otherwise, exit the script.

These programs involve more complex logic and may require interacting with system commands, handling user input securely, and performing various checks based on conditions. They can be useful for automating tasks, managing system resources, and improving system security.
